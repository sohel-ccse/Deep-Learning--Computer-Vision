When we will train our model than our model will achieve high accuracy but our trained model will predict a negative class in maximum number of cases. So, we also need to keep in mind the precision and recall score in such scenarios.\n\nThis problem is predominant in scenarios where anomaly detection is crucial like electricity pilferage, fraudulent transactions in banks, identification of rare diseases, etc. In this situation, the predictive model developed using conventional machine learning algorithms could be biased and inaccurate.\n\nThis happens because Machine Learning Algorithms are usually designed to improve accuracy by reducing the error. Thus, they do not take into account the class distribution / proportion or balance of classes.\n\nThis guide describes various approaches for solving such class imbalance problems using Pycaret."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from pycaret.classification import *","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"clf=setup(data=df,target='Class',fix_imbalance=True) #fix_imbalance will automaticaaly fix the imbalanced dataset by oversampling using the SMOTE method.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"classifier=create_model('rf')\nprint(classifier)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Plotting the classification report\nplot_model(classifier,plot='class_report')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Plotting the confusion matrix\nplot_model(classifier,plot='confusion_matrix')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
